# Beginner Bootcamp Homework

Hello beginner bootcampers. Here is your first formal homework  assignment!


**I expect you to do this assignment individually. I will notice if you copy another students code.**  
To be 100% clear: If I notice you copying other students homework you will get an invoice for the course.  
Don't discuss the homework in slack

- Download the starter files
- Make a local git repo and use it to track your work
- When you're done add a remote and push to your github
- **Send the link to your repo to teachers@codaisseur.com before Saturday 20:00**

Expectations:
- I expect you give this homework assignment your best shot.
- You should be able to complete this homework without my help if there was no time limit.
- I expect you to spend 6-8 hours on this assignment. You can spend more but prioritize enough sleep, doing laundry etc.
- I expect people without experience to be able to implement most tests
- I expect some people with programming experience before this bootcamp to able to finish the whole assignment within the time-limit.
- Implementing all tests and at least one bonus item will get you a green evaluation

Tips:
- Use readest, stackoverflow and documentation
- Check the tests on the page for hints
- You get no points for Extra CSS that is not in the assignment (except the fuzzy feeling in your own brain)
- If you feel you had a bad result write a reflection on your way of working in the readme of your project

## Section 1. Creating the hero object

Follow the tests in the browser

## Section 2. Implementing the basic game logic and UI

**The functions you will be defining are already being called by the test file.** It will complain in the console if they are not working correctly yet.

**note:** You could implement this game logic in many other ways. But in order for the tests to guide you the instructions are very specific.

## Section 3. CSS

- Link an external stylesheet and make all the pictures the same size.

## Section 4 - Bonus: Show me what you got


- Write `displayStats` function that writes your hero's name, health, weapontype, weapon damage to the page. Call it at the end of your script

- Create a form that allow users to change the name of their hero.

- Call `displayStats` when some data of the hero has change to update the page.

- Implement fighting an enemy. (how you do it is up to you!)

- When an enemy or weapon gets clicked it gets deleted from the page
